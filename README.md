# leetCode_Practice
This is a repository containing all the coding practice on LeetCode.
I am still trying to optimize the solutions in this repository to male it clearer.
Some fiels in this repository may include Chinese comments, since it is more efficient for me study. But later on, I will translate them to English. Besides that, some files may provide more than one solutions, because I made some improvement based on the previouse solution.
